# There is no Algorithm for Truth

## Para-Social

* People watch videos/tv programs/... not for the content, but for the presenter
  * Example: Twitch streamers
  * Example: Presenters, like David Attenborough
* Even platforms advertise for this: Patreon example from talk
* In the TV days, there were gatekeepers (like an editor), but with YT and similar, everybody can upload something. Because people don't check, and just trust authority, misinformation can run rampant

Why do you think that people watch streamers for hours at a time playing a game, they could play themselves? - Certainly not because of the game. Rather is is the para-social relationship between the streamer and the viewer.

Parasocial is defined as a one-sided relationship and they were always a thing. In the TV day, people watched programs, like Top Gear or Planet Earth, because of their authoritative presenters.  But it was worth to TV stations, like the BBC, to "reuse" loved presenters as it engaged viewers more. And, even though, the presenter might not be an expert, a team of researchers is working behind the scenes to ensure the accuracy of the content.

At least in case of TV documentaries, radio talk shows or newspaper columnist, there was an editor which proof-read stories. So there was at least some amount of quality control. On social media, everybody has a metaphorical microphone, in which they can spout none-sens all day long, consciously or unconsciously. As we have already discussed, corrections are rarely seen by the same number of people who saw the original post.

If you want more proof that para social relationships are working, look no further than ads on social media. The reason why company spend big bugs on product-integrations and shout outs is because they work. People trust their beloved creators, even if the creator declares the sponsor.

I do want to mention, that there are of course individuals who source all their content diligently. Channel like Tom Scott, Vertasium and many more do awesome work in the science communication field.

* What are advantages to bias algorithms?
  It is handy to have search engines which are biased to your views. Say your looking for cat pictures, a search engine can show you only pictures of cats you like.
