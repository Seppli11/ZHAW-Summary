# Presentation Notes

## OpenAI

* reading too much of his notes / not as fluently
* Good idea to use chat gpt to generate passages
* good slides (minimal, not just reading of the slides, but enough information to help following)
* hand over was good
* only a feature run down - ethical questions, impact on society. 

### Notes

* Introduction: Too detailed, I think should only have 3-4 topics
* numbers (incl. year) should be put on slides
* hand over
* uniform power point design
* How do we need to provide unusual vocas
