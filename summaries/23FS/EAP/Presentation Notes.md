# Presentation Notes

## OpenAI

* reading too much of his notes / not as fluently
* Good idea to use chat gpt to generate passages
* good slides (minimal, not just reading of the slides, but enough information to help following)
* hand over was good
* only a feature run down - ethical questions, impact on society. 

### Notes

* Introduction: Too detailed, I think should only have 3-4 topics
* numbers (incl. year) should be put on slides
* hand over
* uniform power point design
* How do we need to provide unusual vocas

## The jobs we'll lose to machines -- and the ones we don't

Anthony Goldbloom

50% jobs will be eliminated by machines, mostly by machine learning.

ML started with simple tasks, like evaluating credit risk. In 2012 ML could match grade given by experts on tests. 

The advantage of ML is frequent high-volume task as they can process millions of bits per seconds, but they struggle with novel situation. Humans can tackle novel situations, e.g. connect two separate threads. Because of this, there is a limit how much of our jobs machines can automate.

### Summary

Anthony Goldbloom stated in his talk "The Jobs we'll lose to machines -- and the ones we don't" that machines have a big advantage when the task at hand is to process high-frequency, high-volume tasks, since they can process millions of bytes every second without needing to sleep or eat. However, they struggle when they encounter a novel situation, which wasn't included in their training data.

On the other hand, human excel at this. The brain can connect two distance threads to create new original ideas without requiring petabytes of training data. This creates a fundamental limit on what machines can do and how much of our jobs can be automated. Goldbloom estimated that 50% of our jobs will be automated.

Jobs that can be reduced to high-frequency, high-volume tasks will either be completely replaced or in drastically less demand compared to today. Jobs that require original thoughts, such as creating marketing material or a business plan to fill a market gap, will most likely be safe from the machines.
