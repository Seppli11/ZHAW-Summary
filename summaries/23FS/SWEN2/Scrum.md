Scrum is efficient between 5-9 people. Less then there is no communication problem, more, then the people organize them in subgroups.

Scrum teams should be cross-functional, meaning that people with different jobs should work together (developers, UX designers, testers, ...).

In scrum, there are chickens and pigs. Pigs are commited, while chickens are not. Chickens are allowed to attend the daily meetings, but are disallowed to interfeere.

## Scrum Events

### Sprint Review

### Sprint Retrospective

In the retrospective, the team reflects on what was working and what not. It typically takes 15-30 minutes and should be done after evvery sprint with the whole team.

### Daily Scrum

The team should meet daily for a maximum of 15 minutes. Each member talks about what they did yesterday, what they will do today and what they will do tomorrow.

This should improve the communication and render all other status meetings redundent. Importantly, technicial questions are **not** discussed in this meeting.
