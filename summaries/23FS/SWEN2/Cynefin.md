* **Simple/Clear**: There can exist a step-by-step instructions
* **Complicated:** In a complicated system, one needs to consult an expert, but there is still an ordered system
* **Complex**: A complex system can only be understand by probing it and interacting with it
* **Chaotic**: A transistion state in which a system has no rules. The brain strugles dealing with this. In an chaotic system, you do something and see what happens, then you do it again and something else happens.
* **Disorder**:  A transition state where you don't know in which state you actually are and just use the model which is most familiar.
* **Collapse from  complacency**: When a system is overconstraint and looks nice and simple, but then collapses when the reality isn't that simple.

Between complicated, complex and chaotic isn't a strict line.
