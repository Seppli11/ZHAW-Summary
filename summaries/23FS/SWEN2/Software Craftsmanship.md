# Software Craftsmanship

* We will not make messes in order to meet a schedule.
* We will not accept the stupid old lie about cleaning things up later.
* We will not believe the claim that quick means dirty.
* We will not accept the option to do it wrong.
* We will not allow anyone to force us to behave unprofessionally.
