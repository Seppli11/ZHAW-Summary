This report should inform the reader about the annually organized music festival weeks, known as "Musikfestwochen", in Winterthur.

As the summer vacation draws near its end, over 12 days 100 different acts perform on the five different stages at the "Musikfestwoche" in Winterthur. This massive event is held in the core of the old town of Winterthur, where multiple stages are built for the 12 days concert marathon. Most performances are free of charge in the streets of the city. People can just show up and enjoy the music, a beer and food from local restaurants with their friends and family. This is in no small part possible of the many volunteers, who stock up food, reconfigure the audio equipment, sell beverages and donate their time in other ways.

In its latest iteration, it attracted more than 60'000 people. The success of the music festival weeks can be in part attributed to most of it being free for the general public. Additionally by possessing the old town of Winterthur for 12 days straight, it is unmissable by the residents of the larger Winterthurer area.

One possible improvement would be to create better corridors for people to find the toilets and get food and drinks. The small alleys easily clock up by the shear amount of people, creating large and annoying queues. This could be partly avoided by labeling the directions of food stalls and toilets more clearly and route people in away, where they do not have to cross each other.
