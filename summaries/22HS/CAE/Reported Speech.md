# Reported Speech

## Statements

> I don't want a party on my birthday. $\to$ I told my wife that I didn't want a party on my birthday.
>
> The weather was extremely bad. $\to$ The pilot commented the weather had been extremely bad.

Normal statements use `that` between the the reported speech and who the speaker is. However, `that` can be omitted.

## Questions

> Are you Scottish? $\to$ She asked if I was scottish.
>
> Do you want a table near the window? $\to$ The waiter asked whether we wanted a table near the window.
>
> What do you want for your birthday? $\to$ My friend asked me, what I wanted for my birthday.
>
> Who have you invited? $\to$ Jim asked, who we had invited. (not "Jim asked, who had we invited")

A yes-or-no question gets transformed by using `if` or `wheather`.  

If a wh-word (like `what`, `where`,...) is present, it gets used instead of `if` or `wheather`.

Importantly,  the sentence structure is subject + verb.

## Backshift

Because what the quoted person said was in the past, the verbs are backshifted by one tense to reflect that. 

| Original Tense              | Backshifted Tense          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| present simple              | past simple                |
| present continuouse         | past continuouse           |
| present perfect simple      | past perfect simple        |
| present perfect continuouse | past perfect continuouse   |
| past simple                 | past perfect simple        |
| past continuouse            | past perfect continuouse   |
| future (will)               | future-in-the-past (would) |
| past perfect                | past perfect (no change)   |
|                             |                            |

If what the person said is still true, then the no backshifting is necessary. (eg. I'm going to get married next year $\to$ She said, she is going to get married next year. In this case no backshifting is necessary if it is still the same year)
