# Conditional

## Conditional: Always true

> If I work late, I get tired.
>
> If the water is boiling/has boiled, it means the food is nearly ready.

Form: If present, present

States a fact, which is always true.

## Conditional I

> If I find her address, I'll send her an invitation.
>
> I will send her an invitation if I find her address. (notice: no comma)
>
> 

Form: If + Simple Present, will-Future

Conditional I refer to a future event. The condition is likely to be fulfilled.

`when` can be used instead of `if` to signal that it is not a question if it will happen but rather when it will happen.

## Conditional II

> If I found her address, I would send her an invitation.
>
> I would send her an invitation if I found her address.
>
> If I had the money, I could help you. (with the modal verb "can")

Form: If + Simple Past, Conditional I (would + Infinitive)

The conditional II is used when referring to a situation in the present, which would be possible, if things were differently. Like "would would happen if ..."

### With modal verbs

> If you get wet, you should change your clothes immediately.
>
> If you come early, we can discuss the problem together.

A conditional II sentence can be used with either `should` or `can` when referring to the present.

Form: If + past perfect, Conditional I (would + Infinitive)

## Conditional III

> If I had found her address, I would have sent her an invitation (but I hadn't found it...).
>

>
> If you hadn't reminded me, I might have forgotten.

Form: If + Past Perfect , Conditional II (would have + participial)

The conditional III is used to refer to past situations. An action could have happened in the past if a certain condition had been fulfilled.

## When

> When I was young, there were no houses here. (in the past)

> Nobody spoke when she came in to the room. (in the past)
>
> When you start the engine, there's a strange noise. (in the present)
