## semiotic vs pragmatic model

Semiotic models require knowledge prior to the interaction, while in pragmatic model the knowledge is negotiated on the fly.

## Perspectivising

Perspectivising is a process to create a common understanding between multiple parties which don't share a common cultural context.

1. Generalizing: Telling the other, that the communication has broken down (with out sounding condensending) by talking about the a bigger group. For example: *I'm not sure what is expected of me in this behaviour*
2. Perspectivising: Explain your own perspective of the context
3. Contrasting: The speaker connects the different standpoints as sharing a common ground while representing separate aspects.

An example: Question about salary:

1. Generalizing: It's a bit strange that **people in Malta** ask about the salary
2. Perspecitivising: In Switzerland it is a bit strange to talk about this.
3. Contrasting: Your origin doesn't matter, salary is obvious something important. But I'm not really comfortable to talk about this. I hope you don't mind.

### Emic vs Etic Perspective

In the **emic** perspective, you explain something based on your context and how you feel this thing.

In the **etic** perspective, you compare different view points of a thing.

Both perspective are tools to prevent you from repeating cultural mishaps.
