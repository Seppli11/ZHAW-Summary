## semiotic vs pragmatic model

Semiotic models require knowledge prior to the interaction, while in pragmatic model the knowledge is negotiated on the fly.

## Perspectivising

1. Generalizing: Telling the other, that the communication has broken down (with out sounding condensending). For example: *I'm not sure what is expected of me in this behaviour*
2. Perspectivising: Explain your own perspective of the context
3. Contrasting: 

### Emic vs Etic Perspective

In the **emic** perspective, you explain something based on your context and how you feel this thing.

In the **etic** perspective, you compare different view points of a thing.

Both perspective are tools to prevent you from repeating cultural mishaps.
