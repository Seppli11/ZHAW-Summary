## Fine Automaton (FA)

An FA is defined by the file-tuple $(S, A, T, s_0, S_F)$, where

* $S$ is the set of states
* $A$ is the alphabet
* $T$ is a function that takes the current state and the current input character as an argument and returns another state 
* $s_0\in S$ is the start state
* $S_F \in S$ the final state
