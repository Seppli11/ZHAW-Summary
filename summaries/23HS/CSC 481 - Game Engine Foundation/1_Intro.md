While designing, think of different games. The goal is a 2D platformer.

At least keyboard and mouse. For inputs, the real-time inputs should be used, **not** events

The behaviour on collision should be dependent on the platform type (think different types of platforms in  Mario) (one direction collision)

## Reflection

1-2 page paper. At minimum one full single spaced page (This is worth 40% for each section). 

Questions that can be asked:

* What design decisions did you make?
* Why?
* What worked?
* What didn't work?
* What does a design decision offer in the future?

## Readme

Should include instructions on how to compile and run the code.
