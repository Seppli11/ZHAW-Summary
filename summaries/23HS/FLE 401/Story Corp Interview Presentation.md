# Presentation

Welcome to my presentation about my interview with Ray Easterin.

Let's start with who he is: He was born in North Carolina, but ended up growing up in South Carolina. He has a wife and a son. He worked in higher education for 40 years, and for the past 8 years at NC State. He is now retired, but still does some volunteering her and there. Also, he always liked to play tennis.

One think that I found surprising and interesting about him, his how much of his life has been defined by his work. And to understand that, I think we have to start with what he studies in collage.

Initially, he didn't really know what to do. So, he studied sociology in South Carolina. Mostly because it sounded interesting and this was indeed the case. Towards the end of his bachelor degree, he finally figured out that he wanted to do. He wanted to work in higher education, helping students with their career, to get a job, but also to get a sense of what to do in life; Something that he lacked previously. This revelation made him a better student, since he finally had a goal and purpose to study. After completing his master in that field, he started working. 

When talking about the topic of higher education he seemed to be glowing with excitement. He clearly knows a lot about the job market, and to do a smart job search and the like. 

Some interesting facts that he mentioned:

* You're better of doing a narrow job search and focus your effort on a particular job
* about 70% of jobs are never advertised. Instead their given to internal people, like a part-time worker, intern or people in other position
* Event more interesting, people who were referred, tend to do a better job and stay longer

He described higher education as field, where one has to move around to get better position since people tend to stick around. And so he did; Multiple times for a better position, better pay and a new challenge. 

Last year, he retired. However, even now, he still helps people with their career through the volunteering for the church.
