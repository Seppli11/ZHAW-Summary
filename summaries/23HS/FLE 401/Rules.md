Most english nouns are stressed on the first syllable:

* Notebook
* COLlege
* TOtal

However, there are exceptions, like misTAKE, shamPOO, hoTEL and many more

If a word ends in -tion, then the stress is on the syllable before the -tion.

* creAtion
* asSUMPtion
* affiliAtion

For three syllable nouns,  about half are stressed on the first syllable (FAculty, CENtury, ...), and the other half sre stressed on the second syllable (comPUter, anOther, ...). There are few exceptions that are stressed on the third syllable (engiNEER, magaZINE, ...)
