Most english nouns are stressed on the first syllable:

* Notebook
* COLlege
* TOtal
* *many more*

However, there are exceptions, like misTAKE, shamPOO, hoTEL and many more

If a word ends in -tion, then the stress is on the syllable before the -tion.

* creAtion
* asSUMPtion
* affiliAtion

For three syllable nouns,  about half are stressed on the first syllable (FAculty, CENtury, ...), and the other half sre stressed on the second syllable (comPUter, anOther, ...). There are few exceptions that are stressed on the third syllable (engiNEER, magaZINE, ...)

## Schwa /É™/

It is the most common vowel sound in English, typically sounds like short "uh" or "ih" and only appears in an unstressed syllable.
