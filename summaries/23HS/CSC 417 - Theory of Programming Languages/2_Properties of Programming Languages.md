# Properties of Programming Languages

While there are categories (e.g. functional programming, object-oriented programming, imperative programming), languages tend to add different features from different categories. Therefore it makes more sense to assign different properties (i.e. has lambdas, or has classes) to different languages.

A language can be described at a high level with the following properties:

* purpose
* prominent features
  * objeccts, classes, functions, regexes, ....
  * memory management
* syntax 
  The UI of a programming language, like the grammar, key words, ...
* type system
* any notable *semantic* features, outside of the type system
* implementation (native code compiler, vm, jit, ...)
* adaptation
* tooling, platform (OS and hardware) support (if notable)
