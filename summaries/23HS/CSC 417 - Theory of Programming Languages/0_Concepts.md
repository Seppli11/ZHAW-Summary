# Concepts

* static vs dynamic
  If something is *static*, it can be determine at compile time, while something *dynamic* can only be determine, *in all cases*, while running.
  (Bash, for example, has dynamic syntax. It will only detect a syntax error on line 5 after it ran until line 4)
* values ($\approx$ types)
* scope,  identifier, binding
